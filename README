Angelo's Chatzilla plugins.

To install these, simply type /install-plugin in any tab in Chatzilla, and browse to the *_install.zip or init.js file of the plugin you want to use.

I'm always up for a challenge, so if you have a request, please tell me about it. You can find me in irc://moznet/chatzilla under the nick "Angelo".
